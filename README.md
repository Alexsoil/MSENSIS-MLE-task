A simple web application that classifies images of cats and dogs using pre-trained models and allows users to test custom uploads.

## Goal

Build a small ML application that:

- 1. Accepts an image of a cat or dog
- 2. Uses a pre-trained or fine-tuned deep learning model to classify the image (Based on user selection)
- 3. Returns the predicted class and confidence score
- 4. Web UI allowing the pipeline to run from browser
